# Project Name

Project is named Redux Feedback Practice.

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
The Redux Feedback Practice project's purpose is to help further along my understanding of React and Redux, as well as some minor Material UI.

The feedback forms require routes to each question and include input forms/texts or radio buttons, along with next and back buttons for easy navigation.
Users can give feedback on how they are currently feeling about the day. This is useful for instructors to gauge how their students are progressing on a day to day basis, and adjust accordingly.

## Getting Started

Create your database with the data.sql provided. 

Running the following commands to install packages needed, starting up the server and client.
npm install
npm run server
npm run client

## Forms: 
There are four forms needed to complete the feedback request.
First form starts with the "How are you feeling today?" question.
- This form should have an area where the user can enter in a number on how they are feeling for the day from a minimum of 1 to maximum of 5.
- Forms 1 to 3 should have the same inputs.
- Provide a next button for the user to navigate to the next pages for each form.

Second form is "How well are you understanding the content?".

Third form is "How well are you being supported?".

Fourth form allows the user to leave comments for their instructors.
- Comments are not required.

## Review Component
The review component should list all form requests and allow users to review their responses.
- Users should not be able to change their input.
- Include a submit button to send the data to the database.

## Submit the Feedback
After submitting the data to the server, users should see a confirmation page.
- Include a link back to the home page to leave another review.
